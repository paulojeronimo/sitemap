= About

This page is a kind of {sitemap} where, beyond my {blog-posts}, I
({paulojeronimo}) centralize some of my publish links related to
<<finishertech, my current company>> and others about: my
<<git-repositories>>, <<slides>>, <<articles-or-tutorials>>, <<videos>>,
<<running-applications>>, and <<wikis>>.
Finally, in the section <<tags>>, I group my content related to a
specific tech topic.

[WARNING]
====
Currently, this page is only a prototype of a project that I
want to create.
In this version, it is not built with anything but {asciidoctor__}
and some code in {bash_}.

[.text-center]
The code of this page is here: https://github.com/paulojeronimo/sitemap.

Future versions of this page will be generated by some static site
generator or by something I'll write with my hands using very light
technologies like {yaml_}, JSON, {jq_}, and some code in {bash_} or
{python_}, or {typescript_}.
