= About

This page is a kind of {sitemap} where, beyond my {blog-posts}, I
publish some <<finishertech,links related to my own company>> and other
related to code on my <<git-repositories>>, <<slides>>, <<tutorials>>,
<<videos>> and <<wikis>> that I ({paulojeronimo}) produced.

WARNING: Currently, this page is only a prototype of a project that I
want to create.
In this version, it is not built with anything but <<asciidoctor>> and
some code in <<bash>>.
Future versions of this page will be generated by some static site
generator or by something that I'll write with my own hands using some
very light technologies like {uri-links_yaml}[YAML], JSON, <<jq>>, and
some code in <<bash>> or <<python>>, or <<typescript>>.
