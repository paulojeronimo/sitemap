= About

This page is a kind of {sitemap} where, beyond my {blog-posts}, I
({paulojeronimo}) publish some <<finishertech,links related to my
current company>> and others related to code on my <<git-repositories>>,
<<slides>>, <<articles-or-tutorials>>, <<videos>>, and <<wikis>>.

[WARNING]
====
Currently, this page is only a prototype of a project that I
want to create.
In this version, it is not built with anything but {_asciidoctor} and
some code in {bash}.

[.text-center]
The code of this page is here: https://github.com/paulojeronimo/sitemap.

Future versions of this page will be generated by some static site
generator or by something I'll write with my hands using very light
technologies like {uri-links_yaml}[YAML], JSON, {jq}, and some code in
{bash} or {python}, or {typescript}.
