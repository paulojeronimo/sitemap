Beyond {uri-paulojeronimo-posts}[my blog posts], available in the same
Git repo as my leading site, I also have individual Git repositories for
many tutorials and articles listed below.
That causes the need for this sitemap (to keep a central point where I
can share all my content).

My daily work involves writing and producing PoCs about what I want to
learn or practice.
Also, I’ve always been more into writing than creating videos.
[[more-video-production]] But, starting in 2022, I’m also investing a
lot of time to perfect myself in producing more <<videos>>.
