[[videos]]
= Videos

As I said <<more-video-production,here>>, since 2022, I have been honing
my skills in video production, and from 2023 I intend to produce many
more videos.
The most current technical content I published is on <<odysee,Odysee>>,
a Web3 video platform I use a lot.
However, since the end of 2022, I have also started using
<<youtube,YouTube>> again.

Many times, when I want to create videos related to the command line
only and without any sound, I use also like to use and publish videos on
<<asciinema,asciinema>>.
